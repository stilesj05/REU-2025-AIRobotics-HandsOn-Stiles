**Summary:**  
This paper proposes a secure, quantum-enhanced architecture for digital twin systems used in healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) environments. The authors integrate Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) into the digital twin communication pipeline to enhance confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity. The system architecture comprises three layers: the physical IoT layer (including patient-monitoring devices), the digital twin layer (which mirrors the real-time state of the physical system), and the quantum-enhanced security layer. The authors use simulations to demonstrate that their framework reduces security vulnerabilities in standard healthcare IoT systems, particularly during data exchange between patient sensors and central servers. They also employ lightweight blockchain technology to ensure traceability and integrity across the digital twin network.

**Relevance to Our Work:**  
In our simulation, the digital twin of a collapsed hospital must continuously reflect the evolving physical state, including unstable zones, patient conditions, and robot locations. The quantum-enhanced digital twin proposed here ensures that updates to the system (e.g., sensor changes or patient reassignments) are both secure and authentic—a necessary foundation when decisions are being delegated to AI agents in uncertain conditions. We adapt this secure communication infrastructure to support not just IoT but multi-agent coordination and trust scoring, ensuring that no agent receives outdated or malicious data during rescue tasks. Furthermore, while the paper emphasizes data security, our application uses the quantum layer to also perform optimization—routing, triage ordering, or supply delivery—on the digital twin graph, thereby extending the role of quantum beyond encryption into real-time decision making (would also be helpful to Giselle, as she is feeding off of our project and doing more of the cybersecurity aspect of it).
