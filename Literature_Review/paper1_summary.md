**Summary:**  
This paper introduces a factor graph-based model to evaluate and establish trust among agents in a multi-agent system (MAS), focusing on both independent and interdependent agent behaviors. The model uses Gaussian Process (GP) motion planning in conjunction with Bayesian inference to simulate realistic, trust-sensitive path planning behaviors among autonomous robots. It incorporates factors like obstacle avoidance, cooperation, transparency, and proximity safety to determine trustworthy behavior, all within a distributed framework. Unlike traditional centralized approaches, this method is fully decentralized and adapts in real time using local agent interactions and shared testimonies. Each agentâ€™s behavior is modeled as a trajectory within a factor graph, where trust influences are encoded as probabilistic constraints. The simulation demonstrates this model in an unsignalized intersection scenario, where agents (e.g., autonomous cars) must navigate collaboratively based on mutual trust.

**Relevance to Our Work:**  
Our work builds on this by applying the trust modeling methodology to a hospital rescue scenario after a natural disaster. In our case, the agents are rescue robots, medics, and drones navigating collapsed or unstable areas. The trust factor graphs presented in this paper inspire our approach to dynamically re-evaluate trust between agents as new environmental data is received via a digital twin framework. For example, proximity safety and transparency are critical in a rescue scenario where trust violations (e.g., deviating from expected paths, communication dropouts) could lead to delays or dangerous collisions. We extend this by integrating the trust-based decision layer with a quantum optimization backend (QAOA or QUBO), allowing us to reallocate paths and tasks in near-real-time across the hospital graph. The decentralization of trust evaluation also fits well with our goal of distributed coordination across agents affected by signal degradation or partial isolation in damaged hospital wings.
